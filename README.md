# FizzBuzz Task
This is my code for the FizzBuzz task. 

## Running the Code 
To run the code locally you will need node installed on your machine.

Pull down the code, navigate to its directory on your computer in the terminal, and run the following command: 

`node FizzBuzz.js`

You should see the output of the program in the terminal. 

If you don't have node installed you could run the code in your browser. Simply open up the inspector/developer tools, copy and paste the code, and click enter. You should see the ouput in the console.
